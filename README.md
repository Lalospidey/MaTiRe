## About the LAB material

Some of the LABS have been created by me, but some contain actual malware. Always execute the LABS in a Virtual Machine (VM). I cannot be held reliable for any damages caused by the material in this repository.

The LABS I created myself, have been compiled on a VM as well, and can therefore contain certain clues, compression or obfuscation. Up to you to find what is relevant and in correspondence with the LAB exercises from the workshop!


### Help!

If you are having issues, questions or concerns with any of the LABS or accompanying material, just reach out.
